### Business Model
- **Pay-per-lead Model:** Professionals pay for each potential customer (lead) who showed interest in their services, regardless of whether they ultimately close a deal. For example, if a customer submits a request for faucet repair, the plumber pays for this request even if the customer ultimately chooses another service provider.

- **Credit Cost:** $1.42-$1.50 per credit - credits are Thumbtack's internal currency that service providers buy to get contacts of potential customers. One credit usually equals one lead (contact of an interested customer).

- **Credit Packages:** 24 credits for $34.99, 60 credits for $84.99
